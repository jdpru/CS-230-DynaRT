# CS 230 Final Project: Reaction Time Modeling with DynaRT

## Description

DynaRT is a deep learning framework developed to model and predict reaction times (RT) in cognitive tasks, leveraging task-switching paradigms. The project explores the relationship between cognitive stability and flexibility by using neural networks, including feedforward, LSTM, and dynamic variational autoencoder architectures.
